#kamisado-cpp

This is a vague attempt to write something resembling the game Kamisado in C++.
This effort ended up producing a library-looking thing.

At this point, the work is incomplete and the project is mostly for future me to do random stuff anyway.

If you are not me and want to do anything with this, I am not going to stop you.
