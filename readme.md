#kamisado-cpp

This is a vague attempt to write something resembling the game Kamisado in C++.
This effort ended up producing a library-looking thing.
It is likely terrible.

At this point, the work is incomplete and the project is mostly for future me to do random stuff anyway.

If you are not me and want to do anything with this, there is an MIT License but that really should not stop you.

##Playing Around
If you feel like playing just the game (and are therefore extremely bored), compile Play.cpp and then run it.

Everything in this library is in the header files under the namespace "kamisadoCPP", and including Game.hpp or BasicGame.hpp should get all the other files as well.

##Contributing
To all zero people who might be interested in adding stuff, pretty much anything would be appreciated.
There are probably several issues based on the spaghetti code alone, so feel free to yell at me about all of it.


##Possible Future Additions
*Proper Error Detection
*Graphics
*Making Interface Classes
*Adding Proper Documentation

Note that none of these are promised and are unlikely to be added in the near future (or in any future at all).
